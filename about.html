            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <pre>When tea becomes ritual, it takes its place at 
the heart of our ability to see greatness 
in small things. Where is beauty to be 
found? In great things that, like everything 
else, are doomed to die, or in small things 
that aspire to nothing, yet know how to set 
a jewel of infinity in a single moment.</pre>
